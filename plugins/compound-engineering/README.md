## Reviewer Personas

Reviewer personas are **pluggable** — they live in external Git repos and are synced into the plugin via `/ce:refresh`. This lets you customize your review team without forking the plugin.

### Setup

```bash
/ce:refresh
```

On first run, this creates `~/.config/compound-engineering/reviewer-sources.yaml` with a default source and syncs all reviewer files. Run it again anytime to pull updates.

### How it works

- Each reviewer is a self-contained `.md` file with frontmatter defining its `category` (always-on, conditional, stack, etc.) and `select_when` criteria
- The orchestrator reads frontmatter to decide which reviewers to spawn for a given diff
- A `_template-reviewer.md` ships with the plugin as a starting point for writing your own

### Configuring sources

Edit `~/.config/compound-engineering/reviewer-sources.yaml`:

```yaml
sources:
  # Your reviewers (higher priority -- listed first)
  - name: my-team
    repo: myorg/our-reviewers
    branch: main
    path: .

  # Default reviewers
  - name: ce-default
    repo: JumpstartLab/ce-reviewers
    branch: main
    path: .
    except:
      - kieran-python-reviewer
```

- **Sources listed first win** on filename conflicts
- **`except`** skips specific reviewers from a source
- **`branch`** lets one repo host multiple reviewer sets

### Creating a custom reviewer

1. Copy `_template-reviewer.md` from `agents/review/`
2. Fill in the persona, hunting targets, confidence calibration, and output format
3. Set `category` and `select_when` in frontmatter
4. Add to your reviewer repo and run `/ce:refresh`

### Categories

| Category | When spawned |
|----------|-------------|
| `always-on` | Every review |
| `conditional` | When the diff touches the reviewer's domain |
| `stack` | Like conditional, scoped to a language/framework |
| `plan-review` | During plan review phases |
| `synthesis` | After other reviewers, to merge findings |

## Agents

Agents are specialized subagents invoked by skills — you typically don't call these directly.

### Document Review

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `coherence-reviewer` | Review documents for internal consistency, contradictions, and terminology drift |

| `product-lens-reviewer` | Challenge problem framing, evaluate scope decisions, surface goal misalignment |
| `scope-guardian-reviewer` | Challenge unjustified complexity, scope creep, and premature abstractions |
| `security-lens-reviewer` | Evaluate plans for security gaps at the plan level (auth, data, APIs) |
| `adversarial-document-reviewer` | Challenge premises, surface unstated assumptions, and stress-test decisions |

### Research

## Browser Automation

This plugin uses **agent-browser CLI** for browser automation tasks. Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g agent-browser
agent-browser install  # Downloads Chromium
```

The `agent-browser` skill provides comprehensive documentation on usage.

## Installation

```bash
claude /plugin install compound-engineering
```
